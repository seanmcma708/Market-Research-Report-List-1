<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Ventilators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CMV</li><li>AMV</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory ventilators are essential for managing respiratory support in clinical settings. Continuous Mandatory Ventilation (CMV) delivers breaths at preset intervals, ensuring consistent ventilation regardless of the patientâ€™s efforts, making it ideal for patients with severe respiratory failure. Assisted Mandatory Ventilation (AMV), on the other hand, allows patients to initiate breaths, providing support while encouraging natural breathing. Both types cater to different patient needs, with CMV focusing on control and AMV promoting patient involvement in respiration.</p></p>
